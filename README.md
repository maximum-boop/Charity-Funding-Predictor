Charity Funding Predictor

TOPIC: Charity Funding Predictor

Overview

This project work seeks to use binary classifier that will be capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. In the quest for better performance and a business case, increasingly complex methods are being used to model patterns to achieve success. The realism, however provided by these models comes at a cost of greater computational complexity. This work report explores the use of neural networks to help shape the organization going forward.

Data Processing

Data was provided in csv format for this work:

In order to process and work on the data, a Jupyter Notebook was combined with Google Colab since most of the libraries were not adaptable to my computer in this case. However, screenshots and tables were downloaded to give more insight and clarity.

Libraries:

•	Pandas to read and create data frames
•	Seaborn for visualization
•	Sklearn for training and testing and standardizing data
•	Tensor flow for machine learning
•	Keras tuner for hyper parameter optimization
•	Keras layer dense to create sequential model

Data cleaning:

The raw data consists of 34299 names with 12 features in columns. A look at the datatypes and unique columns as shown below gives an idea as to how to clean and process the data.
